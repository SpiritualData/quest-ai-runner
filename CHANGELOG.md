## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **Resource-aware throttling (graceful pause under system overload)** — a long-running lane can
  now notice host overload and stop taking on NEW work instead of thrashing, resuming automatically
  once resources recover. New stdlib-only `quest_ai_runner/resources.py`: `ResourceLimits` (all
  limits OFF by default; set via `RunnerConfig.resource_limits` or env — `QAR_MAX_MEMORY_PERCENT`,
  `QAR_MIN_FREE_MEMORY_MB` for the remaining-resource form, `QAR_MAX_LOAD_PER_CORE`, plus
  `QAR_RESOURCE_RESUME_MARGIN` hysteresis (default 10%) and `QAR_RESOURCE_CHECK_INTERVAL` re-check
  cadence while paused (default 30s)) and `ResourceGuard` (samples `/proc/meminfo` /
  `os.getloadavg`, optional `psutil` fallback; logs a WARNING naming the tripped limits on entering
  overload and INFO on recovery; an unreadable metric disables its limit, warned once). The pause is
  LOSSLESS by design: the poller gates pickup before discovery (heartbeat still fires so the env
  stays live), re-checks per task mid-batch (deferring before mark/claim so the task re-fires), and
  `run_forever` waits at the guard's shorter re-check cadence while paused so the lane resumes
  promptly. Unclaimed tasks stay queued on the backend; in-flight tasks are never killed. Nothing
  configured → the guard is a no-op (backward compatible).
- **Leaner per-step planner view (older `gathered` compressed)** — the bounded plan→gather→re-plan
  loop re-fed the cheap PLANNER the ENTIRE cumulative `gathered` blob verbatim on every step, which
  grows fast on multi-read runs. The planner now sees a LEANER view: the newest
  `OrchestratorConfig.planner_recent_full` observations in full, and everything older collapsed to a
  one-line summary (source/path + key finding) so the planner still knows the ground it covered and
  won't re-issue the same read. The full `gathered` is unchanged and is still what the final ANSWER
  is synthesized from — only the planner's per-step input is trimmed. Two new config knobs (both
  additive, defaulted): `planner_recent_full` (default 4) and `planner_compress_over` (default 6);
  compression only engages once `gathered` exceeds `planner_compress_over` observations, so short
  runs are byte-for-byte identical to before. New helpers `_render_gathered_for_planner` and
  `_summarize_observation` in `core/orchestrator.py`; `_render_gathered` (full render) is untouched.
- **Task handler stamp + live execution-progress stream** — the runner now records WHO ran a task
  and streams its execution lifecycle to the task, so a Quest task-detail view can show "handled by
  X" and a live progress feed. `QuestClient.claim(task_id, handler=None)` stamps the handler on the
  in-progress PATCH (omitted when None → backward compatible), and the poller resolves the handler
  as the rep slug (basename of the `rep_sync_resolver`'s `skill_dir`, e.g. `"joshua"`/`"subham"`),
  falling back to `RunnerConfig.runner_label` or None. New `QuestClient.report_progress(task_id,
  kind, text=, output=, data=)` POSTs `{kind, ...non-None}` to `/api/assistant-tasks/{id}/progress`
  (kind in started|status|exec|output|done|error) and is best-effort: it never raises, logging a
  warning on failure. `TaskExecutor` emits `started` on pickup, fans each real deep milestone to
  BOTH the originating chat AND the progress stream (kind `exec`), and emits a terminal event from
  the result (done→`done`, needs_you→`done` with a paused note, failed→`error`). All progress posts
  are best-effort and degrade cleanly against an older client without `report_progress`.
- **AI-rep ↔ skill-file sync (`runner.rep_sync`)** — keep a team AI rep's Claude skill file in sync
  with its Quest profile in ONE call: `sync_rep(client, team_id, user_id, skill_dir, direction=...)`
  (and the underlying `pull_rep_to_skill` / `push_skill_to_rep`). Pull renders the rep's `persona`
  and `learned_notes` into the skill file's runner-MANAGED sections (delimited by
  `<!-- QAR:MANAGED:... -->` markers, so any human-authored content is preserved and re-render is
  idempotent); push reads those sections back and PUTs them to the profile. `QuestClient` gained
  `get_ai_profile` / `update_ai_profile` / `add_rep_correction` over
  `GET|PUT /api/teams/{team_id}/members/{user_id}/ai-profile` and
  `POST .../corrections` (reuses the existing urllib client + bearer auth; no new HTTP). The poller
  has an OPT-IN `rep_sync_resolver` on `RunnerConfig`: when set, it pulls the rep's latest profile
  into its skill file right before running that rep's task (best-effort — a sync failure never breaks
  execution). Off by default, so existing lanes are unchanged.
- **Discovery tools on `RetrievalAdapter`** — `list_sources()`, `describe_source(name, path=...)`,
  `list_operations()`, and `describe_operation(name)` let the brain learn what a source of truth
  CONTAINS (collections/doc-sets, their fields) and what OPERATIONS it can call, instead of needing
  a static schema/operation blob pushed into the planner prompt. Each returns
  `Observation(kind="query")`, so results flow into `gathered` through the same path as a read and
  batch in parallel. Two levels each: a cheap LIST (names + one-liners) and a DESCRIBE drill-down.
  Exposed to the planner as four new `reads[]` spec-shapes (`{"list_sources": true}`,
  `{"describe_source": "<name>"}`, `{"list_operations": true}`, `{"describe_operation": "<name>"}`);
  the planner prompt teaches the brain to DISCOVER before guessing, neutrally (no source/operation
  is favored). `RetrievalAdapterBase` ships non-abstract defaults and the orchestrator dispatches
  via `getattr`, so older structural adapters keep working (a discovery spec degrades to a benign
  "not supported" Observation). `FilesAdapter` enumerates readable files + heading outlines;
  `CachedDbAdapter` takes optional `sources`/`operations`/`describe` and otherwise infers fields
  from a sample row.
- **`EVENT_EXEC` + `DeepRunner.run_goal(emit=...)`** — a deep runner can now stream its
  EXECUTION LIFECYCLE (generated code, each execution attempt, its raw output, retries, done/error)
  by emitting `ProgressEvent(type=EVENT_EXEC, data={"phase": ...})`. The orchestrator passes a live
  `emit` callable to runners whose `run_goal` accepts it (decided by signature inspection, so older
  `run_goal(*, goal, brief, model, max_turns)` signatures keep working and are never double-called).
  `EVENT_EXEC` is intermediate texture — NOT in `SURFACING_EVENTS` — so a LIVE run shows it while a
  BACKGROUND (`MilestoneSink`) run drops it, like the other chatter types. This lets an attended
  chat surface live code-execution + retries while a queued task stays quiet.

- **`ClaudeCliProvider`** — a keyless `ModelProvider` that drives the local `claude` CLI headless,
  so the orchestrator's planner/answer calls run on the box's Claude Code **subscription login**
  with no `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` (the deep-runner already ran keyless this way; now the whole runner
  can). The CLI can't force `tool_choice`, so `plan` instructs the model to emit the `decide`
  tool's JSON and parses it leniently (degrading to a safe `answer` on any failure). `list_models`
  returns `[]` so the `ModelRegistry` uses its fallback tier map; tier ids map to CLI family
  aliases. The spawned process has API-key / session env vars stripped (subscription only).

- **Multi-environment heartbeat** — `RunnerConfig.env_id` (env var `QAR_ENV_ID`) is sent on the
  environment heartbeat so a team can attach SEVERAL runners, each registering as its own
  environment. Omitted = the team's default environment (single-runner deployments are unchanged).

### Changed
- **Deep-step status copy** — the live status emitted when the orchestrator enters the `deep`
  action is now a neutral `"working on this now…"` instead of `"this needs real work — running a
  goal-driven task"`. The old wording read as jargon (and conflated "task" with a consumer's own
  goal objects) when surfaced verbatim in a chat; the neutral phrasing travels better across
  consumers and drops the em dash.
- **CLI** — `QAR_MODEL_BACKEND` (`anthropic` | `claude_cli`) selects the model backend; when unset
  it auto-selects `claude_cli` (keyless) unless `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` is present. The runner now
  works out of the box on a subscription login with no API key. The CLI also reads
  `QAR_RUNNER_LABEL` and `QAR_ENV_ID` for the heartbeat.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-06-05

Initial public release.

### Added
- **`core`** — the domain-free orchestrator brain: a bounded plan → gather → re-plan →
  answer/deep/confirm loop, with the frozen streaming interface (`Mode`, `ProgressEvent`,
  `StreamSink`, `MilestoneSink`) and the live↔background handoff.
- **`runner`** — the queued-task executor: an event-driven, signature-deduped poller; a claim
  step; an executor that maps results onto the Quest task callback; and a `QuestClient` covering
  discover / claim / report / escalate / loop-close.
- **The four adapter interfaces** — `RetrievalAdapter`, `ModelProvider`, `DeepRunner`,
  `EscalationSink` — plus reference implementations (`FilesAdapter`, `CachedDbAdapter`,
  `AnthropicProvider`, `SubprocessGoalRunner`, `QuestDecisionSink`).
- **`RunnerConfig`** + factory helpers and capability derivation (`web` / `corpus` / `code`).
- **`quest-ai-runner` CLI** — an env-driven console entry point for the poller.
- **Examples** (`examples/`) — a custom consumer, a runnable lane, and a live end-to-end demo.
- **Tests** — offline core-loop, model-registry, mode/streaming, runner (mock client), and
  example wiring tests.
